If you're interested in helping out with the code, or just want to try the latest version, you should build from source.
All the code needed to run a server or a client is available in
our [main monorepo](https://github.com/worldforge/worldforge).

There are instructions available on how to setup dependencies through Conan, and how to build the various components.

### Get other code

We host all of our code on [Github](https://github.com/worldforge). While most features can be found in the main
monorepo we also have a couple of other repositories containing code that might be of interest.
