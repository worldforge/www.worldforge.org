Are you interested in helping out with developing the system? Awesome! We're always pining for new developers.
Developers of all sizes. Perhaps you know a little bit Python? Or you're familiar with C++? Perhaps you're an excellent
artist, or a talented 3d sculptor. Might be you're a composer, or a sound technician. You might be good at web design.

And so on. The point is: whatever you can do, we welcome your contribution.

Everything we do is 100% Free Software. All of our code is available, as is all of our assets.

#### Getting involved with the community

If you want to get involved with the project you absolutely have join the chat on Gitter. Most of the

you most easily can get in contact with other developers. This site also has a helpful "Open Chat" feature to the right.

In general you should look through how you can interact with the [community](/community).

#### Diving into the code

If you're a coder and want to help out with coding you should start by getting all code set up by cloning and building
[the code](https://github.com/worldforge/worldforge). We provide all of the code needed both for server and client in
a monorepo.

Once that's done you probably want to look closer at how everything [fits together](/develop/technical-overview). You
will want to look closer at the various [components](/components). Look through the code
at [Github](https://github.com/worldforge). See if there are any tasks or bugs registered in
the [Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/worldforge). And of course hang out with us on IRC and the mailing list.

#### Working with media assets

If you're an artists who want to contribute to the project you'll find that there are a nigh endless amount of things
