The Worldforge project is made up of many different components, which initially can be confusing. Creating a virtual
world is a daunting task, and there are many areas which require specific technical solutions. We've been going at this
for quite some time and has created a collection of libraries and various technologies that we use throughout the
project.

### For the impatient

If you're new to Worldforge and just want to dive into it, you probably only need to know
about [Ember the client](ember) and [Cyphesis the server](cyphesis).

### For the patient

If you're more patient you perhaps rather want to also read up on the [Atlas](atlas) protocol, or the [Eris](eris)
client library, or the [Mercator](mercator) terrain system. You might be interested in the [Varconf](varconf)
configuration system, the [WFMath](wfmath) math library or the [Metaserver](metaserver). Keep in mind that all code is
available for all of our systems, for you to both inspect and alter.

You also want to take a look of the default [worlds](worlds) that we provide.
