The Cyphesis server is mainly written in C++ and provides scripting though Python. All the rules that make the world
tick are written in Python. However, so far there hasn't been a good way to provide good documentation for the bindings.
Any Python develop would have had to either look at previous code, or look up the actual bindings themselves.

With a recent [change](https://github.com/worldforge/cyphesis/commit/a1860e719f511a4d73dd619eb63d379d777b9bb7) we now
provide automated Python ["stubs"](https://github.com/worldforge/cyphesis/tree/master/docs/python), which helps a
lot. The documentation isn't complete as we're currently missing the properties of the classes; we so far only expose
the methods and functions. However, it's a good start to allow for a better developer experience.

If you're doing development, now make sure that the directory "docs/python" is included into your Python paths, and
you should get access to these stubs.
